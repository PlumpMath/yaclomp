#+TITLE: YACLOMP

YACLOMP -- Yet Another Clojure Org-Mode Parser

* Why?

Because I like writing in Org Mode a lot better than Markdown (or
Textile or ...).

* Why Another One?

- I want to use (and get better at) Instaparse
- I want to have a quick feedback /
improvement cycle, since I plan to use this for my own projects.
